# sync-pkg [![NPM version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/sync-pkg.svg?style=flat)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sync-pkg) [![NPM downloads](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/sync-pkg.svg?style=flat)](https://npmjs.org/package/sync-pkg) [![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/jonschlinkert/sync-pkg.svg?style=flat)](https://travis-ci.org/jonschlinkert/sync-pkg)

CLI to sync only basic properties from package.json to bower.json.

## Install

Install with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install sync-pkg --save
```

### API

```js
var sync = require('sync-pkg');

// omit fields using glob patterns
sync(['!description', '!foo*']);

// extend existing bower.json
sync(null, {
  extend: true
});

// allow empty fields
sync(null, {
  empty: true
});
```

## CLI

Run `sync-pkg` in the command line to create and/or update bower.json.

```sh
$ sync-pkg
```

* If `bower.json` exists, it will be updated with values in package.json.
* If `bower.json` does not exist, you will be asked if you want to create one.

### Commands

#### bower

Create a bower.json file and/or update the existing bower.json. Equivalent to running `sync-pkg` without the `bower` command, except that it will automatically create a bower.json file if one does not exist, and you will not be prompted.

```sh
$ sync-pkg bower
```

#### diff

See a visual diff of proposed changes between package.json and bower.json. Does not modify any files.

```sh
$ sync-pkg diff
```
